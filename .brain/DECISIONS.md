# ⚖️ MedRecord_App (MedRec) — Technical Decisions

## 2025-02-10 — React Native with Expo SDK 52 & Expo Router

### Decision
Build the mobile client using React Native with Expo SDK 52 and Expo Router file-based navigation.

### Reason
Allows cross-platform iOS and Android builds from a single TypeScript codebase while Expo Router provides declarative, URL-based deep linking essential for scanning QR code share links.

### Alternatives
- **Flutter**: Strong framework, but TypeScript ecosystem allows sharing validation schemas and types between frontend and Node.js backend.
- **Native Swift/Kotlin**: Too resource-intensive to build and maintain two separate codebases.

### Consequences
Fast mobile development cycle and seamless Expo Go testing on physical iOS/Android devices.

## 2025-02-18 — Dedicated PostgreSQL over NoSQL Document Store

### Decision
Use PostgreSQL with standard relational tables and foreign keys instead of MongoDB.

### Reason
Medical records require strict referential integrity, reliable foreign key cascades on user deletion, and robust ACID transaction guarantees for audit logging and time-limited token expiration.

### Alternatives
- **MongoDB / NoSQL**: Flexible schemas, but lacks strict relational constraints and ACID guarantees across distributed sharing sessions.

### Consequences
High data consistency and compliance-ready data modeling for health records.
